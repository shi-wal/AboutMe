# Hey, I'm Shivangi!
I'm currently pursuing B.tech. in Computer Science & Engineering and expect to be graduated in 2021. Being a CSE engineer, I've been being a relish fan of python since starting. Besides this web development is also the part of my career enhancement. From beginning of my coding journey, I've worked in python & have a basic knowledge of Machine Learning algorithms.<br/>
